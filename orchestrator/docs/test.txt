OsTicket es un sistema de ticket  Para interno de la empresa


Post-Install Setup Guide
Once osTicket has been installed you need to further configure it via admin panel before it is fully usable. Only staff with admin’s privileges can access the admin panel. Please use the username and password created during the install process.

Email Setup
Setting up your system to accept emails varies from system to system and your personal preference. osTicket allows you to route unlimited number of emails as incoming tickets. For detailed instruction please see Email Settings Guide.

Help Topics
In addition to emails, clients/users can also use an online form to create tickets. Help topics helps maps online inquiries to a department and assigns priority without the need for the user to select a department or/and ticket priority. This gives you ability to route inquiries without exposing internal departments.

Departments
Departments are used to categorize incoming tickets and also as access mask for staff members. For example you can restrict staff’s tickets access based on departments. To manage departments go to the Departments tab in the Admin Panel.

Staff Members
osTicket allows you to add unlimited number of representatives to the system. Each staff member is assigned to a group and a department which determines the level of permission. Every staff account can be of type ‘Admin’ or ‘Staff’.

System Preferences
To disable or change system settings, go to Settings Tab in Admin Panel.




Email Settings
osTicket allows you to setup unlimited number of email addresses to handle all your company’s mail accounts and email communication. Incoming emails are converted to support tickets allowing you to easily manage, organize and archive all emailed support requests in one place.

Email Templates
osTicket ships with generic email templates used for auto-responses, alerts, notices and replies. Refer to Email Templates Guide for details on how to customize or add new templates.

Routing Incoming Emails
Setting up your system to accept emails varies from system to system and depends on your personal preference. osTicket currently supports piping (aliases) and POP3/IMAP polling methods for routing incoming emails. Tickets are routed to the department and assigned a default priority associated with the email.

To enable incoming email fetching, in the Admin panel go to Settings and Email, and check the box for Email Fetching to enable it. It is disabled by default.

EMAIL PIPING

Piping method allows for real-time email handling. Extra setup is required at mail server level to pipe the raw email message to osTicket pipe handler. Both remote and local piping are supported. See Email Piping Guide.

POP3/IMAP POLLING

POP3/IMAP account polling method is best suited for individuals with remote mail account(s) and/or with limited access to mail delivery settings. Each email address added to the system can have an account associated to it. See POP3/IMAP Setting Guide.

Outgoing Emails
By default osTicket uses native PHP Mail function to send outgoing emails. However, this can be problematic to spam filters depending on your php.ini mail settings. It is highly recommended that you use SMTP instead.

Each of the email accounts can have it’s own SMTP. You can also setup a default SMTP system wide. See Settings tab in admin panel.

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING USE OF EXTERNAL SMTP SERVERS

Some hosting companies (Hostgator.com, for example) do not allow the use of SMTP servers located on a separate server and will block all requests. Trying to connect to a blocked external SMTP server will result in a “login failure” message in OSTicket when trying to save the Outgoing Emails settings.

If you have shell access with your hosting account you can manually test a connection to a remote SMTP server from the command line using telnet:

telnet smtp.example.com 25
A blocked connection will result in a message similar to the following:

Trying 192.0.32.10...
telnet: connect to address 192.0.32.10: Connection refused
OUTGOING SMTP SPOOFING

Check “Allow spoofing (No Overwrite)” in Settings => Email Settings

Outlook Configuration

Gmail Configuration

In order to use Gmail, your host must support SSL, so osTicket can negotiate the secure connection, and you must enable IMAP or POP in your GMail or GApps account. Configure in osTicket (the easy part)

Under Admin panel -> Emails -> Emails -> Sending email via SMTP For most people, enter either ssl://smtp.gmail.com with port 465 or tls://smtp.gmail.com with port 587.

note: If you have a google apps/G-Suite account, this might change, see below.

Select “Authentication Required”. Leave Header Spoofing unchecked. Make sure your username is your full email and password are set correctly in the Email Login Information

If you test at this point and it doesn’t work, continue reading.

You may need to consult your PHP error log (the location varies by OS and personal preferences so consult your php.ini to determine its location). The PHP error log often contains more information as to why something is not working correctly.

Check your Firewall

Connection Refused errors are most likely caused by your firewall.

If you are running csf, it defaults to block outgoing SMTP connections. You can either turn off SMTP_BLOCK (not recommended) or add the user osTicket is running under to SMTP_ALLOWUSER. Also make sure the port you are using (465 or 587) is in SMTP_PORTS.

If you are running some other firewall, make sure it is allowing outgoing connections on 465 or 587.

note: if you are running SELinux please disable it to see if that makes this start working. If it does then SELinux is blocking the connection and you will need to re-enable it and write a rule to allow the connection.

Check Gmail

Not related to SMTP, but make sure you enabled IMAP or POP3 from Settings -> Forwarding and POP/IMAP

To enable POP for your Gmail account.

To enable IMAP for your Gmail account.

You may need to “allow less secure apps”. From gmail, click your avatar at the top right of the page and click “My Account”. In the left menu, under Sign-In & Security, click “Connected Apps and Sites”. Scroll down to “Allow less secure apps” and turn it on and retest.

It is recommended to not leave this on unless necessary.

Check your G-Suite policies

G-Suite allows you to use their SMTP Relay service. This service allows you to open up SMTP under certain conditions. To use this service, you must configure it under Apps -> G-Suite > Gmail > Advanced Settings -> General Settings -> Routing Add an SMTP relay service with the appropriate settings. Make sure you change your osTicket configuration to use smtp-relay.gmail.com as the SMTP server.

See https://support.google.com/a/answer/2956491?hl=en for more information.

POP3/IMAP Settings Guide
If email piping is not a preferred option for you or if your hosting provider does not support it, you may use POP3/IMAP account polling instead. osTicket will poll an external POP3/IMAP account on a regular basis, retrieve email messages and convert them to tickets. It is best suited for individuals with remote mail account(s) and/or limited access to mail delivery settings.

Enable mail fetch in Admin Panel => Settings => Email Settings
Refer to your hosting manual or contact your hosting provider for host name and port number
Configure fetch frequency for each of the accounts - 5 minutes recommended
Enable Delete fetched message(s) - if your mail server doesn’t support auto-archiving on fetch
Schedule Polling
IMPORTANT: Simply checking Admin Panel => Settings => Email Settings => Enable POP/IMAP email fetch will not cause osTicket to automatically poll a mailbox for new messages. Account polling, unlike email piping, requires that a mail fetcher (script) be scheduled for repeated execution. Choose one of the methods below depending on your hosting environment.

RECURRING TASKS SCHEDULER (CRON JOB)

This is the most convenient method if your hosting provider allows scheduling recurring tasks via crontab on nix or “Scheduled Tasks” on a Windows server. Please refer to your hosting manual or contact your hosting provider for instructions. The PHP CLI executable is called to run cron.php.

Add the following entry to cron file normally in /etc/crontab in nix systems and adjust: the time; the webuser; and paths accordingly.

*/5 * * * * nobody /path/to/php /path/to/api/cron.php
For windows users in “Scheduled Tasks” add "c:\php\bin\php.exe c:\website\osticket\api\cron.php"

RECURRING TASKS SCHEDULER (HOST’S CUSTOM TASK SCHEDULER)

Some hosts do not allow adding cron jobs, and instead only allow you to probe scripts located at a publicly accessible URL. In this case, you will schedule the task using your webhost’s scheduling interface and http://domain/path/to/osticket/api/cron.php.

To prevent unauthorized execution of scripts from the outside, Settings => API has rules for allowing external access based on originating IP and an API “passphrase”, which is actually the User Agent string of the agent trying to access cron.php on your web server.

If the User Agent string is not changed to the API key, the request will be denied, email will not be polled, and API error - code #77: Unknown remote host 181.222.32.12 or invalid API key [Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/9.0.597.84 Safari/534.13] will appear in your system logs under the osTicket dashboard.

If your host allows you to modify their schedulers User Agent string, then change that to the API key and add your webhost scheduler’s IP to Settings => API => API Keys.

EXTERNAL TRIGGERING USING WGET

First add an API key and IP to Settings => API => API Keys.

Enter the IP of the host that the wget will run from.
Enter 3 separate words into the passphrase box (these are used in conjunction with the IP to generate hashes)
Click submit
A hash will be generated
Then, setup a cron job to run wget */5 * * * * nobody wget -q -O /dev/null --user-agent=<API key here> http://<host & path goes here>/api/cron.php

See forum post.

AUTO CRON

This is internal task manager triggered by staff’s activity, no external setup required! If enabled, emails are fetched based on activity of a logged in staff member at an interval set for each of the email accounts.

Enable in Admin Panel => Emails => Settings and ensure Email Fetching Fetch on auto-cron is enabled.
Please note that nothing happens if no one is logged in.
It might slow the page load a little in some instances.
Maximum of one cron call every 3 minutes per staff


Email Piping
The email piping is a technique of sending email message as an input to a program rather than appending the message to the mailbox file, allowing for real-time email delivery and handling. Every mail server has its own rules and procedures for mail delivery, making it hard to provide common instructions for configuring an MTA. You should refer to your hosting manual or contact your hosting provider for email piping instructions if none of the methods below works for you.

osTicket supports both remote and local piping
Email piping must be enabled in admin panel Note: This option appears to be removed from v1.7 - piping works without enabling.
Local Piping
Local piping refers to the case where osTicket is installed on a server also handling your emails. Most shared hosting users fall into this category.

SETTING UP ALIASES IN CPANEL

Add a forwarding rule for each of the email addresses to /path/to/api/pipe.php.

For example forward support@domain.com to "|/path/to/api/pipe.php"

CPANEL X INSTRUCTIONS

CPANEL -> Email -> Forwarders -> Add Forwarder

Address to a forwarder: @domain
Advanced Options -> Pipe to a Program: public_html/osticket/api/pipe.php
Click ‘Add Forwarder’ button
When complete you will see:

@domain to |/home//public_html/osticket/api/pipe.php

assumption is you unpackaged osticket.tar in /home/USERNAME/public_html/
Pipe to a Program path: if you have a leading ‘/’ cPanel will use the path you enter, if you do not have ‘/’ cPanel will create it relative to your home directory
pipe.php should have hashbang at the top of the file: #!/usr/bin/php -q
Make pipe.php executable chmod 755 pipe.php
Enable email piping in admin panel Settings -> preference Note: This option appears to be removed from v1.7 - piping works without enabling.
MAIL DELIVERY FAILED

If you have the error: ‘Mail delivery failed: returning message to sender’ but the user’s email is still successfully processed.

You have some options:

1. Update php.ini

/usr/local/lib/php.ini update: display_errors Off

restart apache

2. Update exim.conf

Update /etc/exim.conf in the section:

address_pipe:

driver = pipe
return_output
virtual_address_pipe:

driver = pipe
group = "${lookup{$domain}lsearch* {/etc/userdomains}{$value}}"
return_output
user = "${lookup{$domain}lsearch* {/etc/userdomains}{$value}}"
Change return_output to return_fail_output

REASON: (from exim.conf comment)

If the pipe generates any standard output, it is returned to the sender of the message as a delivery error. Set return_fail_output instead of return_output if you want this to happen only when the pipe fails to complete normally. You can set different transports for aliases and forwards if you want to - see the references to address_pipe below.

SETTING UP ALIASES WITH QMAIL

Create/Edit your .qmail-* for the domain you wish to forward and add a forwarding rule to /path/to/api/pipe.php. For example for support@domain.com .qmail-support file should contain |/path/to/api/pipe.php

SETTING UP ALIASES FOR SENDMAIL

Modify your aliases file by adding support: root, |/path/to/api/pipe.php and run newaliases.

SETTING UP ALIASES IN .PROCMAILRC

:0 c
   * ^To.*support@domain.com
   |/path/to/api/pipe.php
Remote Piping

Remote piping is useful when osTicket installation and the mail server are on two separate machines. To maintain logic in one place remote piping is done over HTTP post to osTicket’s API. osTicket ships with two scripts to help you accomplish this task; automail.php and automail.pl. Both accomplish the same task by posting to http://www.yourdomain.com/osticket/api/tickets.email (replace osticket with the folder name where you installed osticket)

Remote host IP must be white listed in Admin Panel > Manage > API Keys
Valid API key required
Follow local piping instructions above to pipe emails to remote script which will in turn post to osTicket
For technical details, please refer to API Docs.

Upgrade and Migration
Before embarking on an upgrade or a migration mission, it is extremely important that you backup your website’s database and files. We also recommend that you take the system offline momentarily during the process. While we try to ensure that the upgrade process is straightforward and painless, we can’t guarantee it will be the case for every user. For this reason it is crucial that users take precautions in case of any problems. If the thought of upgrading your installation gives you the shakes then feel free to contact us for help.


Upgrade
From time to time it will be necessary to upgrade your osTicket installation to the latest version, either to fix bugs or gain new features. Starting with version 1.6, osTicket is a complete rewrite with new database schema and code base making it hard to simply upgrade from previous versions.

Only previous versions from version 1.6 RC1 can be upgraded to the current version.
If your osTicket version is older than 1.6, you need to look into migration instead.

Our objectives is to make upgrading from an earlier release as painless as possible going forward and support migration from discontinued versions. we are working with osTicket community on the best way to upgrade or/and import data from previous versions including 3rd party helpdesk systems.

Uploading Files
After you have successfully downloaded the osTicket package to your computer you will need to prepare the files to be uploaded to your web server, where the old version of osTicket is running - overwriting the existing files. This can be accomplished by decompressing the download and then using an FTP client to transfer files in upload directory/folder to your server, overwriting existing osTicket files. For user using control panels like CPanel or Plesk, you can utilize the systems file manager to upload the package to your server then simply extract the package while making sure the path hierarchy is maintained.

Make sure you backup your site’s database and files PLEASE DO NOT SKIP
Upgrader requires user with admin privileges
It is recommended that you take the system offline during the upgrade
Maintain the directory hierarchy to make sure files are overwritten
Upload folder contains the osTicket files that need to be uploaded to your web server.
Do not overwrite your ost-config.php file (in the include directory) or else you will lose your MySQL admin settings.
Do not upload files in scripts folder. Only useful for remote piping
For versions 1.6 RC1-RC2 Only: Once you’ve overwritten the files, rename config.php to ostconfig.php (config.php is found in root osTicket directory).
For newer versions the config.php or ostconfig.php file should be renamed to ost-config.php and moved to the /include folder.
Note: If you’ve customized your osTicket installation, you will need to port the changes to the new version following a successful upgrade. Database changes might cause conflicts.

Running Upgrade Script
osTicket ships with web-based upgrade wizard to help guide you through the upgrade process. While the wizard provides step by step guide it is important and helpful to have general knowledge about Web servers, PHP and MySQL. Any errors at this stage, although unexpected, are fatal and might require restoring previous version.

To run the upgrade script, simply login to admin panel of your osTicket helpdesk. The upgrader is now a primary component of the osTicket, so upgrades are triggered automatically anytime you upload a new version which requires a database migration.

When you access the admin panel, the upgrade wizard will be presented and will automatically walk you through the database migration process. Your helpdesk will remain offline, and your staff will be unable to do anything in the staff panel until the database migration has completed.

Warning: If you are upgrading from osTicket 1.6 to osTicket 1.7 and above, please ensure that your attachment upload folder has read and write permission for your http server software. Attachments that are not readable by the http server will be lost in the upgrade process.

Post Upgrade Testing
Once the upgrade has completed, browse to the staff control panel (scp) and check basics such as viewing and responding to test tickets to ensure things still work as expected. After verifying that the upgrade completed correctly do the following:

Enable the help desk
Delete setup directory
Explore any new feature—see Release Notes
Take a minute to send us feedback
Migration

We plan on supporting data migration from previous discontinued versions of osTicket as well as 3rd party help desks in the near future. Please check the forums for up to date discussions on the subject.

Variables are added to a template message by typing %{

Variables in Templates Two
From there variables are displayed to choose from, or you can manually enter a custom variable set within your Forms.

Variables in Templates Three Variables in Templates Four
Built-In Variables

Within each email template there is a Supported Variables option in the upper right corner that will provide a partial list of built-in variables available. As the forms are built out to contain additional fields there will be more variables available to be used in the email templates and canned responses.

Built In Variables
Creating Custom Variables

You can create your own custom variables, specific to custom fields on your Forms.

Forms are located at Admin Panel > Manage Tab > Forms. Start by selecting the Form that you would like to edit:

Custom Variables One
Next, you will either add a new custom field, or locate one that’s already been added by you previously. In the Variable column of the field you will add a custom name for the variable. You can use both letters and numbers in variables, and variables should have no spacing between words. This variable can later be included in Email Templates or Canned Responses by typing %{ticket.customvariablename}.

Custom Variables Two Custom Variables Three
If you add a variable to a template and receive the above error message, please note this does not mean the variable is incorrect. This message is alerting the variable may not be value for all instances when the template message is sent out.

Data Extraction Guide
Exporting Ticket Data (CSV)
Agent Panel > Tickets

Ticket Exports allow Agents to export ticket header information in a CSV format. This export includes only metadata—such as ticket ID, status, creation date, assigned user, and other key details.

Agents can customize the exported data by selecting which metadata fields to include. Additionally, exports can be filtered by queue or Advanced Search, enabling Agents to refine results based on:

Ticket Data
User-related Data
Custom Queue
This functionality provides a streamlined way to extract and analyze ticket data while maintaining control over the exported information.

Advanced Search
Advanced Search allows Agents to search and filter tickets based on unique ticket criteria.

OAuth2 Guide
Authentication
OAuth Authentication allows Agents/Users the ability to use Single Sign-on to log into the helpdesk through the provider you set up. The most commonly used providers are Microsoft, Google, and Okta.

Authorization
Attention

Microsoft has started deprecating certain Outlook endpoints used in Modern Authentication (OAuth2) for Emails. Note, this does not affect user/agent authentication. These deprecations started causing errors similar to The API version v2 has been depreciated when the system attempted to retrieve a new set of Tokens. This prevented new Tokens from being generated which caused authentication failures. We have now made changes to the OAuth2 plugin to support the latest Microsoft deprecations.

Please follow the steps listed here to address the issue.

OAuth2 Authorization allows emails the ability to authenticate against a mail server using the OAuth2 protocol. This eliminates the need to store the password locally and instead redirects you directly to the provider to login. Most provider’s are phasing out Basic Authentication (username + password) for Modern Authentication (OAuth2) but if you host your own mailserver you may not have OAuth2 available. The most commonly used providers are Microsoft and Google.

Setting Up The Plugin
First you will need to download the plugin from our website. Make sure you have selected v1.17 or higher and select the ‘Authentication :: Oauth2’ plugin. Once the file is downloaded, copy the plugin file into the include/plugins folder and add the plugin:

Multifactor Authentication
Multifactor Authentication, sometimes referred to as Two Factor Authentication, adds an extra layer of authentication set up for Agents.
when they log into the helpdesk. Once they correctly submit their username and password, they will be required to submit a token to finish logging into the helpdesk.


Agents can configure their Default 2FA settings by going to their profile.

Agent Profile


Agent Profile 2FA
By default, Agents are not required to set up Multifactor Authentication. An administrator can require Multifactor Authentication by going to:

Admin Panel | Settings | Agents | Require agents to turn on 2FA

Require Multifactor Authentication
Once enabled, Agents will be required to configure and save their Default 2FA method before accessing the helpdesk.

Configure 2FA


2FA Options


Configure Email 2FA 1


Configure Email 2FA 2


Configure 2FA Token


Configure 2FA Verify Token
Once 2FA has been configured, the Agent must also save the configured method as well.

Choose Default 2FA


Save Default 2FA
The next time the Agent logs into the helpdesk, they will be prompted to enter a token to finish logging into the helpdesk.



Agent Login


Agent Verify Token


Agent Token Email


Agent Submit Token
An administrator can edit the Email Template sent for the verification token by going to:

Note: The template variable that contains the token is %{otp}

In the event that an Agent becomes locked out of their account, an Administrator can reset their 2FA configuration by going to:

Admin Panel | Agents | click Agent | Reset 2FA

Reset 2FA

Visibility Permissions
New Permissions have been added to limit the visibility of Departments, Agents, and Help Topics based on an Agent’s Department access.


These permissions can be found by going to:

Admin Panel | Agents | Select an Agent | Permissions Tab | Miscellaneous

Permissions Boxes
New Permissions:
‘Agent — Ability to see Agents in all Departments’
‘Department — Ability to see all Departments’

Both of these boxes are checked by default for new Agents as well as existing Agents (in the case of an upgrade).

Throughout this documenation, as an example, let’s say I have an Agent with Access to only the Support Department.

Department Access
The Agent has the following set for Permissions:

Permissions Example
Agent — Ability to see Agents in all Departments
When this box is unchecked for an Agent, the Agent will only be able to see Agents who belong to a Department they have access to within the Agent Panel.

An Administrator can easily see which Agents should be visible within the Agent Panel of the helpdesk by doing an Agent Export and comparing Department permissions for the desired Agent.

Export Agents
Here is what the export looks like. The names of Agents that will be visible are purple.

Agent Export
Note: Agents set to on Vacation do not show up throughout most of the Agent Panel.

Based on this export, Agent Adriane1 should be able to see Adriane2 and Adriane3 throughout the Admin Panel.

Note: They can see themselves as well.

Department — Ability to see all Departments
When this box is unchecked for an Agent, the Agent will only be able to see Departments they have access to within the Agent Panel.

Let’s take a look at the Departments in our example helpdesk. Remember, Adriane1 only has access to the Support Department.

All Departments
Note: Archived and Disabled Departments do not show up throughout the Agent Panel.

This permission also limits Canned Responses that an Agent can see.

The Agent will only be able to see Canned Responses for Departments they can access (Primary or Extended Access) or Canned Responses assigned to all Departments.

Canned Responses
Agents are only able to create/edit Canned Responses for Departments they have access to as well.

New Canned Response
Help Topics
Help Topics are hidden from the Agent Panel if they are assigned a Department an Agent does not have access to and the Agent does not have the ‘Ability to see all Departments’ permission checked.

Here are the Help Topics for our example helpdesk:

All Help Topics
If a Help Topic is Public, it will be shown in the Agent Panel.

If a Parent Help Topic is Private and assigned a Department an Agent does not have access to, we hide both the Parent and Children Help Topics.

If a Help Topic is assigned the System Default Department, it is shown throughout the Agent Panel.

Note: Archived and Disabled Help Topics do not show up throughout the Agent Panel.

Based on our screenshot, Feedback, Report a Problem, and Access Issue should be hidden based on the permission checked.

Archived and Disabled would not show up either, regardless of the permission since they are not Active.

Note: Even though we do not have access to the Outlook Department, General Inquiry will still show up since it is a Public Help Topic.

Filtered Topics:

Topic Visibility 1
Note: Archived or Disabled Help Topics still show up for quick filters and searches.

When the Department Permission box is checked, all Help Topics are visible.

ACL (Access Control List)
The Access Control List (ACL) feature allows you to enter a single IP address or a comma separated list of IP addresses to allow access to the system. Essentially, this means whatever IP address is in the ACL field will have access to the specified Panels of the software. If the field is left blank your helpdesk is open to the world. This feature is useful for those who wish to lock down their helpdesk to certain clients, to just their internal network or just to list of IP addresses.

ACL List
The ACL List is pretty straightforward as it’s just a simple Textbox field in which you can insert a single IP address or a comma separated list of multiple IP addresses. For now, it only accepts the full IP address format of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. Eventually we plan to accept an IP range format, wildcard format, etc. but for now let’s keep it basic. If you insert multiple IP addresses you have to use the Comma Separated List format of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy.

ACL List
Note:

IPs cannot have a trailing comma otherwise a validation error will be thrown.

ACL Validation Error
Apply To
After the ACL List is populated you can then choose an Apply To option. The Apply To option states which panel(s) the ACL will be applied to. There are four options in the Apply To dropdown that you can choose from. The first option is called “Disabled” which means the ACL feature will be Disabled. The second option is called “All” which means the ACL will be applied to all Panels in the helpdesk. The third option is called “Client Portal” which means the ACL will only be applied to the Client Portal. The last option is called “Staff Panel” which means the ACL will only be applied to the Staff/Admin Panel.

ACL Apply To Dropdown
Example Usage
Let’s go through an example together so we can see how this feature works. Let’s say we want to lock down our helpdesk and we only want the following IPs to have access to the entire system (192.168.100.100, 192.168.100.101, 192.168.100.102). We would go to Admin Panel > Settings > System and scroll down to the ACL section. Now, since we have multiple IP addresses we have to use the comma separated list format. In the ACL List textbox we can enter the following 192.168.100.100, 192.168.100.101, 192.168.100.102. Since we would like to lock down our entire helpdesk we can choose the All option in the Apply To dropdown. Once complete we can Save Changes and from then on only the specified IP addresses can access the helpdesk. Anyone else trying to visit the site will be denied with Access Denied error.



Agent CSV Export
Admins are now able to download a CSV export that displays all Agents in the system as well as their access to each Department.


Go to:
Admin Panel | Agents Tab | Agents

All Agents
Click the down arrow beside ‘More’ and choose the ‘Export Agents’ option.
Export Agents
CSV Output:
Export Agents Output
The output shows each Agent, their Username, and their Status as well as the Permissions they have. Each additional column shows the Departments in the system as well as each Agent’s role for that Department. If the Agent does not have access to a Department, the Role is left blank.



Archiving Departments and Help Topics
Occasionally it could become necessary to no longer use certain Departments or Help Topics within a helpdesk. Even though they will no longer be used in the future, there could be some Tickets that are still assigned to the Department or Help Topic. In addition, there are important Dashboard Statistics already stored. To resolve these issues, Admins may now choose to Archive Departments or Help Topics.

Departments:
Departments can have a status of Active, Archived, or Disabled.

Active departments can be selected for new tickets and used throughout the system as usual.

Archived departments may not be chosen for any new tickets. If a closed ticket receives a response from a user and has an Archived department, a new ticket will be opened referencing the ticket’s old title and number. It will have the System Default chosen as the Department.

Closed ticket in Archived Department:

Archived Closed Department 1

Archived Closed Department 2
User response to the Closed ticket:

Closed Archived Department Response
A new ticket is now opened referencing the ticket’s old title and number if a User replies by email to the closed ticket.

Disabled departments may not be chosen for any new tickets either, however, if a closed ticket receives a response, the system will reopen the ticket.

Closed ticket in Disabled Department:

Closed Disabled Department
User response to the Closed ticket:

Response Closed Disabled Department
Changing the Department Status:
1. Go to: Admin Panel | Agents Tab | Departments

Click a Department to modify.
Edit Department 1

Edit Department 2
Modify multiple Departments at once.

An agent can change the Status of multiple Departments at once by selecting the checkbox beside each Department to modify and selecting the desired option in the ‘More’ dropdown.
Edit Multiple Departments
Help Topics:
Help Topics behave in the same way as Departments. They may have a status of Active, Archived, or Disabled.

Closed ticket in Archived Help Topic:

Closed Archived Department 1

Closed Archived Department 2
User response to the Closed ticket:

Archived Help Topic Response
A new ticket is now opened referencing the ticket’s old title and number.

Closed ticket in Disabled Help Topic:

Closed Disabled Help Topic
User response to the Closed ticket:

Closed Disabled Help Topic Response
Changing the Help Topic Status:
1. Go to: Admin Panel | Manage | Help Topics

Click a Help Topic to modify.
Edit Help Topic 1

Edit Help Topic 2
Modify multiple Help Topics at once.

An agent can change the Status of multiple Help Topics at once by selecting the checkbox beside each Help Topic to modify and selecting the desired option in the ‘More’ dropdown.
Edit Multiple Help Topics
When viewing Dashboard Statistics for Departments and Help Topics, Agents will be able to see the statistics for Disabled or Archived items, and it will state whether the items were Archived or Disabled.

Collaborators
Collaborators are additional participants that may be included in a Ticket’s communications.
This document will outline changes that have been made to how this feature works.

New Features:
Add collaborators as well as CC them when opening a ticket from the Agent Panel.
Add collaborators as well as CC them when replying to a ticket as an Agent.
Manage collaborators (add/remove collaborators).
Change the email address where a ticket is sent out from.
View recipients that receive a reply from an agent.
As an end user, there is now an icon on the ticket list view to determine if you are a collaborator.
New Email Template variables.
New setting to hide Tickets where the User is a Collaborator in the Web Portal.
Collaborators on Ticket Open:
When an Agent creates a Ticket on behalf of a User, they now have the option to add Collaborators.
They also have the option to alert all (User and Collaborators), alert only the User, or do not send an email alert.

*Note: If the ‘New Ticket by Agent’ autoresponse is disabled Agents to not have the Ticket Notice options.

Collaborators Open Ticket
Collaborators on Ticket Reply:
Similarly, an Agent can add Collaborators or choose which Collaborators receive an email when replying to a Ticket.
Initially upon viewing a Ticket, the Agent can see how many Collaborators the Ticket has.

Collaborators Ticket Reply
By clicking the arrow beside Collaborators, the Agent is given more options for how to handle Collaborators in their reply like
adding new Collaborators or managing existing Collaborators.

Collaborators Ticket Reply Expanded
Collaborators that are removed by clicking the ‘x’ in the left corner of the their name will be disabled in the Ticket,
meaning they will no longer receive any of the Agent’s responses.

Collaborators Ticket Reply Expanded
Disabled Collaborators can easily be Enabled again by reselecting and enabling them.

Collaborators Ticket Reply Expanded

Collaborators Ticket Reply Expanded
To completely remove a Collaborator, the Agent must go to ‘Manage Collaborators’.

Manage Collaborators:
There are several places where an agent can go to manage collaborators. The first is beside the User’s name on the ticket.
There is a group icon with the number of collaborators the ticket has.

Manage Collaborators Users
The second place is in the drop down menu next to the ticket settings icon. There is an item to ‘Manage Collaborators’.

Manage Collaborators Dropdown
Finally, you can manage collaborators by clicking the Collaborator listing at the bottom of the Ticket or by
clicking in the expanded Collaborators menu.

Manage Collaborators Users

Manage Collaborators Users
After clicking one of these options, the menu appears to manage the collaborators.
The trash can to the far right of the row allows you to remove collaborators from a ticket.
You can also add new collaborators.

*Note: The checkbox to the left of the Collaborator’s name indicates if the Collaborator is Enabled or Disabled. Disabled Collaborators will not receive Ticket responses.
This action is the same as clicking the ‘x’ in the left corner of a Colalborator’s name in the expanded Collaborator menu at the bottom of the Ticket.

‘From’ Email:
In the past, tickets were always sent out using the email address belonging to the Ticket’s Department.
Agents are now able to choose which email address a ticket is sent out from if your system has more than one email configured.

From Email
By default, tickets are sent out from the email address chosen for the department’s Outgoing Email.
The department’s default address can be modified by going to:

Admin Panel | Agents Tab | Departments | Choose a Department | Outgoing Email

Outgoing Email
Collaborator Responses:
An Agent is able to determine that a Collaborator has responded to the ticket by looking at the label next to each message.

Collaborator Response:

Cc Response
User Response:

User Response
*Note: When a User or Collaborator replies to an email, Alerts are NOT sent out to other participants,
while Alerts ARE sent out when a User or Collaborator replies using the Web Portal.
This is simply because the User or Collaborator has the option to reply to all recipients or to reply only to the helpdesk when replying to the email.

View Email Recipients:
Any time an email is sent out whether it is from the Agent or the User, there is now an option to see who the email was sent out to.
This can be done by clicking the drop down arrow beside a Ticket thread and selecting ‘View Email Recipients’.

User Response:

User Response

User Recipients
Agent Response:

Agent Response

Agent Recipients
Additionally, an Agent is able to see if a response was a Reply All, Reply to User, or reply to no one by looking at the tag in the corner of the Thread Entry.
*Note: When a Ticket is created on behalf of a User, the initial message entered by the Agent will have the appropriate tag as well.

Reply Tag
Collaborator Icon:
When end users log into the system and view the list of tickets they have access to, they will now see an icon beside the ticket name if they are a
Collaborator on the ticket. If there is no icon, they are the ticket owner.

Collaborator Icon
Email Template Variables:
Ticket Recipients:

Format: %{ticket.recipients} This variable displays a list of visible/active users that are collaborating on a ticket.

Hide Collaborator Tickets:
In some instances, Agents may only want their Users to see their own Tickets if they log into the Web Portal rather than every Ticket they participate in.
We now have a setting to control this.

If the Agent would like to disable Users from seeing their Collaborator Tickets, they can configure the setting here:
Admin Panel | Tickets | Settings | Collaborator Tickets Visibility

By default, Users are able to see all Tickets they participate in.

View of All Tickets:

Release Assignment
The Release Assignment feature allows Agents to release ticket assignment from other Agents and/or Teams. Agents may only access this feature if they have the new Release Role Permission assigned to them. An important thing to note is Department Managers do not need the Role Permission in order to release assignment of tickets within their Department.


Release Role Permission
To access the Release Assignment feature the Agent’s assigned Role for the Department must have the Release Role Permission enabled. To enable the permission for any Role an Administrator may navigate to Admin Panel > Agents > Roles and click on the name of the desired Role. Under the Permissions tab, check the box next to the Release permission, and Save Changes.

Release Role Permission
Release Agent & Team
Upon viewing an assigned ticket a Release (unassign) Ticket option will appear in the More dropdown (Cog-wheel Icon). Clicking this option will introduce a Release Confirmation modal on screen. If a ticket has both an Agent and Team assigned checkboxes will appear next to each name giving the option to choose whom to release assignment from. Checking both boxes will release assignment from both the Agent and Team. Checking one box will release assignment from only the selected Agent/Team.

Release Agent & Team
Release Agent or Team
If a ticket has only one Agent or Team assigned the modal will simply ask to confirm the release.

Release Agent or Team
Internal Note
Both modals give Agents the ability to input a reason for releasing the assignment. If a reason is given it is added to the ticket thread as an Internal Note.

Release Internal Note
Thread Event
When an Agent releases assignment a Release Thread Event is added to the ticket thread. This thread event shows who released whose assignment and contains a date and time stamp of when the released occurred.

Task Revamp
The Task Revamp improves upon the current functionality of tasks by adding the following:

Task due date must be before ticket due date
Add an Internal Note to the Ticket when a Task is completed
Send an Alert to the Assigned Agent/Team when task is complete
Task Due Date
When creating a Task for a Ticket, we now ensure that the Task’s Due Date is before the Ticket’s Due Date

Ticket Merge/Link
This feature introduces 2 new capabilities in the system: merging and linking Tickets.


The Ticket Merge feature allows you to combine two or more Tickets so that their threads will all be in one Ticket. We will call this the Parent Ticket.

Linking allows you to group tickets together without actually manipulating any Tickets. It just gives you a quick way to access Tickets
that may be related in some way.

Merge and Link Role
In order for an Agent to be able to merge or link Tickets, they must be assigned a Role that has permission to do so. In my examples, only the ‘All Access’ Role
has permission to merge or link Tickets. This can be configured by doing the following:

Go to:

Admin Panel | Agents Tab | Roles | Choose a Role | Click the Merge/Link checkbox

Merge Role
Merging Tickets
When Tickets are merged, all Ticket threads reside on one Parent Ticket. Any responses sent to a Child Ticket will automatically be routed to the Parent Ticket.
If Child Tickets remain in the system, they will simply be there as a historical record of any fields that were populated on the Child Tickets.

Merging Tickets
On the Parent Ticket, merged Thread Entries have the merge icon on them, and hovering over the icon will show the Ticket Number of the Child Ticket.

Merging Tickets
Both Tickets have a thread event indicating that the Tickets were merged.

There are 2 ways to merge Tickets:
1. From within a Ticket
2. From the Tickets queue

Merging from within a Ticket
The ‘Merge Tickets’ option can be found by going to the More dropdown.

Merging from within a Ticket
Once clicked, the Agent will see the Parent Ticket, which is the Ticket they are currently in, as well as the options available when merging Tickets.

Merging from within a Ticket
The first Ticket Number displayed in the list is the Parent Ticket. Moving a different Ticket to the top of the list will change the Parent to that Ticket.
Once a Ticket has been made a Parent, other Tickets can be merged to the Parent, however, the Parent Ticket can NOT be merged to any additional Tickets.

Merging from within a Ticket
Merge Options
There are several different options that can be chosen when merging Tickets. We will outline the following below:
- Participants
- Merge Type
- Delete Child Ticket
- Move Child Tasks to Parent

Participants
The Participants dropdown allows you to choose how participants of child Tickets will carry over to the Parent Ticket. By default, this is set to ‘User + Collaborators’.
This means that participants of the child Ticket will be added as Collaborators to the Parent Ticket if they are not already participants of the Parent Ticket.
If the ‘User’ option is chosen, the User of Child Tickets will be added as Collaborators to the Parent Ticket if they are not already the User or a Collaborator on the Parent Ticket.

Merge Type
There are 2 types of Merges:
1. Combine Threads
2. Separate Threads

Combine Threads: Threads from all Tickets will be displayed chronologically.

Merge Type
Separate Threads: Threads from Tickets will be displayed one Ticket at a time.

Merge Type
Delete Child Ticket
Checking this box will result in Child Tickets being deleted upon merging. Data from the Child Tickets is no longer in the system, so the Parent Ticket will not
be displayed as a merge, but rather a regular Ticket. It will still have a thread event stating that another Ticket was merged into it, and each child thread entry
will have the merge indicator icon beside it.

Delete Child Ticket

Adding Tickets to be Merged
In order to merge in another Ticket, the Agent simply types the Ticket Number into the ‘Select Ticket’ box, select the desired Ticket, click Add a Ticket, and then Save Changes.

Adding Tickets to be Merged

Adding Tickets to be Merged
Merging from the Tickets Queue
*Note: The Merge button will be displayed as long as the Agent has the Merge Role permission for at least one Department they have access to; they can only
merge tickets within the departments they have the Role permission to do so. If you do not have permission to merge Tickets from a Department, you will see the following error message.

Adding Tickets to be Merged
If an Agent has a Role with permissions to merge Tickets, they can do so from the Tickets queue for Tickets of that Department. This can be done by using the check
boxes to select Tickets to merge and then clicking the ‘Merge’ button at the top right of the screen.

Merging from the Tickets Queue

Merging from the Tickets Queue
Once selected, the Agent can drag the Ticket they would like to be the Parent Ticket to the top of the list and then Save Changes to merge the Tickets.

Merging from the Tickets Queue

Merging from the Tickets Queue
*Note: For merges, Children Tickets do not show up in the main Ticket queue, however, Agents can still search for them. In this example, Ticket #265518 is the
Parent Ticket and Ticket #516834 is the Child Ticket.

Hovering over the merge icon will allow Agents to see the type of merge that was done.

Ticket Permissions
Ticket Permissions for merged Tickets are based upon an Agent’s access to the Parent Ticket’s Department. If Tickets with different Departments are being merged,
the Parent Ticket will automatically be referred to the Child Ticket’s Department so that the Agent will have access to both the Parent and Child Ticket. To read
more about Ticket Referrals, go here.

Linking Tickets
Linking Tickets is similar to merging Tickets, however, linking Tickets does not actually combine thread entries. Linking Tickets simply adds a link to related
Tickets. The Tickets behave exactly as they did before with replies going to their respective Tickets. Linking can be done within a Ticket or from the Ticket queue.

Linking from within a Ticket
The ‘Link Tickets’ option can be found by going to the More dropdown.

Linking from within a Ticket
Once clicked, the Agent will see the Parent Ticket, which is the Ticket they are currently in, as well as the options available when linking Tickets.

Linking from within a Ticket
Notice that for linking Tickets, Agents only have the option to add Tickets since thread entries are not affected when linking Tickets. All Ticket data remains the same when linking.

The S3 Folder Path is an optional field that allows you to specify a folder or folder path within the bucket to store files in.

Note: If the folder or folder path provided does not already exist in S3, it will be created automatically.

The AWS Region of your bucket can be found in S3 by going to the Bucket and clicking the Properties tab.

AWS Region
Default ACL for Attachments refers to the permissions you want for the files stored in S3. If you aren’t sure which option to choose, you can default to the properties already configured for the Bucket.

For the Access Information section, you need to specify IAM user credentials for a user that is set up with access to S3.

Once you have successfully configured the plugin, you will be able to have the helpdesk store attachments in the S3 by going to:

Admin Panel | Settings | System | Store Attachments

Change the ‘Store Attachments’ option to ‘S3’

Now, when an Attachment is added in the helpdesk, it will be saved in S3.

Open Ticket With Attachment


Ticket With Attachment
If you have access to the database, you’ll notice that attachments stored in S3 can be found in the ost_file table, where ost_ is your table prefix. If the attachment is successfully stored in S3, there will be a 3 in the bk column. Files stored in the database have a D in the bk column.

Attachment in Database
If you have access to the server where the osTicket files are stored, you can see the available backends that can be used by running the following:

php manage.php file backends

Show Backends
You can migrate the files from the database to S3 by running the following command in the terminal:

php manage.php file migrate --backend D --to 3

Where backend refers to the bk column in the database, D stands for the current backend being used, Database in this case, and 3 stands for the backend you want to switch to which is S3 in this example.

The following configurations can be set for passwords:

Minimum length
Character classes required
Password strength
Enforce on login
Password reuse
Password expiration
Minimum length
Passwords must have at least the amount of characters specified here.

Character classes required
The different classes referenced here are uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, and special characters (Ex: @,#,$,>,etc.).
Depending on the option you choose here, (2, 3, or 4), passwords must contain characters in at least that many classes.

Character Class Options
Password with two classes:
Password

Password with three classes:
Passw0rd

Password with four classes:
Pa$$w0rd

Password strength
Password Strength Options
For password strength, you can choose to accept any strength, or you can choose to specify that passwords must have a strength that is at least weak, good, strong, or awesome.
The strength of a password depends on characters used, the case of characters used i.e. uppercase or lowercase, and the length of the password.
The easiest way to increase password strength is to use different classes for the characters in a passsword. The less classes used, the more the length of the password would need to be
to meet the strength requirement. You can read more about password strength here.

Enforce on login
If you choose to enforce the password policy on login, Agents and Users will be prompted to update their password to meet the requirements of the policy before using the helpdesk.

Enforce on Login
Password reuse
By default, the password policy plugin is configured to force Agents/Users to create new passwords when resetting them, however, an Administrator can check this box to allow the same password to be used multiple times.

Password expiration
Password Expiration Options
This gives Administrators the option to choose how often Agents/Users should be required to change their password. By default, this option is set to where passwords never expire.

Setting the Password Policy
Once the password policy has been configured, the Administrator can choose the policy for Agents and/or Users.

To use the password policy for Agents, go to:
Admin Panel | Settings | Agents | Password Policy | Password Management Plugin

Agent Password Policy
To use the password policy for Users, go to:
Admin Panel | Settings | Users | Password Policy | Password Management Plugin

User Password Policy
Note: ‘Default Basic Policy’ refers to the legacy policy that was put in place prior to the current version of osTicket. The previous policy allowed Administrators to set the
password expiration for Agents. If none was set up previously, passwords in the current help desk will never expire.




Attachments on the Filesystem
The Attachments on the Filesystem plugin allows you to store attachments in a folder on the filesystem instead of the database. This can be a good option to use for helpdesks that have a heavy load of attachments that are taking up a lot of storage in the database.


First, you must download the plugin from our website. Please make sure you select the appropriate version of osTicket before proceeding to the plugin selection. Once downloaded, upload the plugin to your server and place it in the include/plugins/ folder. Make sure the plugin has appropriate file permissions and ownership so the webserver can read and execute.

Now you can install the plugin by logging into your helpdesk and navigating to Admin Panel > Manage > Plugins. Click Add New Plugin and click Install next to the desired plugin.

Add New Plugin


Install Plugin
To enable the plugin click on the name of the plugin in the list of installed plugins, set Status to Active, and Save Changes.

Enable Plugin
Once the plugin has been installed and enabled, it can be configured by going to:

Admin Panel | Manage | Plugins | Attachments on the filesystem | Instances

All Plugins


Attachments on the filesystem Instances
To add a new instance simply click Add New Instance. Give the new instance any Name you want, set the Status to Active, and click the Config tab to start configuring the instance.

Add New Attachments on the filesystem Instance


Attachments on the filesystem Configuration
You will need to provide a folder where the attachments can be stored. You will also need to ensure that the folder can be written to.

Note: If the path does not start with ‘/’ or a drive letter, it will be assumed to reside in the root folder of your osTicket files.

Filesystem Folder
Once you have successfully configured the plugin, you will be able to have the helpdesk store attachments in the filesystem by going to:

Admin Panel | Settings | System | Store Attachments

Change the ‘Store Attachments’ option to ‘Filesystem’

Store Attachments Setting


Save Settings
Now, when an Attachment is added in the helpdesk, it will be saved in the ‘ostAttachments’ folder.

Open Ticket With Attachment


Ticket With Attachment


Attachment in Folder
If you have access to the database, you’ll also notice that attachments stored in the filesystem can be found in the ost_file table, where ost_ is your table prefix. If the attachment is successfully stored in the filesystem, there will be an F in the bk column. Files stored in the database have a D in the bk column.

Attachment in Database
If you have access to the server where the osTicket files are stored, you can see the available backends that can be used by running the following:

php manage.php file backends

Show Backends
You can migrate the files from the database to the filesystem by running the following command in the terminal:

php manage.php file migrate --backend D --to F

Where backend refers to the bk column in the database, D stands for the current backend being used, Database in this case, and F stands for the backend you want to switch to which is Filesystem in this example.

Command in Terminal
Once the command has been run, you can look back in the database and you will notice the the bk field now shows F for all of the attachments since they have been migrated.

Command in Terminal
The attachment folder specified will also be populated with the newly migrated files.

Command in Terminal



Installation
osTicket comes with its own web-based installer to help guide you through the installation process without the frustration. While the installer provides step by step guide during the installation process, it’s important and helpful to have general knowledge about Web servers, PHP and MySQL.

Prerequisites
To install osTicket, your server must have Apache/LiteSpeed/IIS webserver (with the URL Rewrite module installed/enabled), PHP 8.1 - 8.2 (8.2 recommended), and MySQL 5.0 (or better) installed. If you are unsure whether your server meets these requirements, please check with your host or webmaster before proceeding with the installation.

You will need one MySQL database with valid user, password and hostname handy during installation. MySQL user must have FULL privileges on the database. If you are unsure whether you have these details or if the user has sufficient permissions, please consult your host or database admin before proceeding.

WINDOWS RECOMMENDED LINKS

PHP 8.2/8.1 for Windows Server: Download
MySQL 8.0 for Windows Server: Download
MariaDB 10.11 for Windows Server: Download
PHP Manager 2 for IIS (makes managing PHP on IIS much easier): Download
Getting Started
At this point you should have downloaded latest version of osTicket. Uncompress the files and upload files and directories in upload folder to a directory of your choice on your server. For example /osticket/, /helpdesk/ or /support/ depending on your preference. Basic knowledge of using FTP is a plus at this stage. If you don’t know how to use FTP, we would recommend you read the documentation supplied with your FTP client and learn the basics of uploading and setting permissions on files.

osTicket installer needs to be able to write and modify ost-config.php found in the include directory. Please follow the instructions given by the installer.

Using Installation Script
Once all of the above steps are complete, you can complete the installation and basic setup in a web browser. You can invoke the installer by simply browsing the osTicket URL e.g http://www.yourdomain.com/support. Alternatively you can enter the URL to it into your browser address bar e.g http://www.yourdomain.com/support/setup/.

osTicket’s installation script will attempt to auto-detect paths and any permission issues. Please follow the instructions to finish up the installation process.

If the script spots any configuration errors then it will not allow you to continue until the errors are corrected.
If everything checks out, you will be presented with a form to fill in the required information.
If any errors occurs, go back and check the data entered.
On valid data the script will create and populate the database plus write a configuration file.
Note that the installer performs basic configuration required to get osTicket up and running. Further configuration is required, post-install, to make the system fully functional.

Installing osTicket Using Fantastico In CPanel
osTicket can also be installed on CPanel based web hosting accounts using Fantastico.From your CPanel, click on Fantastico and follow the instructions to install osTicket.

IMPORTANT:

The Fantastico default installation package (as of 9 Jan 2010) installs osTicket with the default email address of support@system.com. If you install using Fantastico, you MUST immediately change your default email addresses in the main System Preferences and in your Department settings.
The Fantastico package for osTicket may not be as up to date as the latest release available on osTicket.com. Please check the osTicket.com website for the most up to date version.
Finishing Up
If the setup script has finished running with no errors, then congratulations osTicket is now installed. You can now log in with the username and password you created during the install process. After verifying that the installation completed correctly - your next step should be to fully configure your new support ticket system for use. But before you get to it please take a second to cleanup.

Change permission of include/ost-config.php to remove write access
Delete setup directory
Enable the system
Once you have done the above, you can proceed with the next step, Post-Install Setup.

HAVING TROUBLE

We can help install and configure osTicket to your needs. Please learn more about our professional installation services.

Self-Help Troubleshooting
If you can not find any solutions to the problem you are having, you can enable the “Show Errors” flags located in /bootstrap.php (or /main.inc.php in older versions):

# Don't Display Errors
ini_set('display_errors',0);
ini_set('display_startup_errors',0);
Change this to:

ini_set('display_errors',1);
ini_set('display_startup_errors',1);
Then errors should be displayed either in your web browser or in your server’s error.log file.

Moreover, don’t forget to check your osTicket Dashboard page and your mail server log.
